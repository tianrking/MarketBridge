# Development log

## 2026-09-12 — Clock and freshness foundation

- Replaced timestamp-per-call increments with real observation time. Unique
  event ordering must use separate sequences; timestamps can repeat.
- Refresh quote stale status on reads, including predicates, without changing
  original receipt time or transport latency. Reject unknown/far-future times.
- Added deterministic fixed-clock regression tests (no sleeps).
- Adopted the generic research-only [platform roadmap](platform-roadmap.md).
- Repaired an incomplete local Rust toolchain (missing manifest). Rust 1.98.1
  now compiles the project on Windows/MSVC.
- Validation: the working-tree suite including these regressions passed
  `cargo +stable test --locked`: 270 passed, 0 failed. `cargo fmt` and
  `git diff --check` passed. No remote CI or live-provider certification claimed.
